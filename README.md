#Color Clash: Duel of Hues

#Overview

Color Clash: Duel of Hues is a fast-paced, strategic two-player game where opponents face off in a vibrant battlefield, wielding long rectangular shooters. Each player secretly selects an "unfavorable color" at the start of a round, which they must defend against while simultaneously attacking their opponent with that same color. A central distributor provides a random assortment of colored bullets, adding an element of chance and strategy to the duel. The first player to fill their opponent's gauge to 100% by hitting them with their unfavorable color wins the round and earns a point. The game continues across multiple rounds, with the player holding the highest score at any moment gaining a strategic advantage in bullet selection.

#Gameplay Mechanics





Players and Setup: Two players face each other, each controlling a long rectangular shooter positioned opposite one another.



Unfavorable Color: At the start of each round, each player secretly chooses one of four available colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow) as their "unfavorable color." This choice remains hidden from their opponent.



Objective: Players aim to shoot bullets of their opponent's unfavorable color to increase their gauge. The first player to fill their opponent's gauge to 100% wins the round and earns one point.



Bullet Distributor: A central distributor generates a random, infinite sequence of four colored bullets at the start of each round. The player with the higher score (or a random player in case of a tie) selects two of the four colors, and the other player receives the remaining two.



Shooting and Defense: Players shoot their assigned colored bullets at their opponent while attempting to block or dodge incoming bullets of their own unfavorable color. Successful hits with the opponent's unfavorable color increase their gauge.



Winning Condition: The round ends when one player's gauge reaches 100%. The winner gains a point, and a new round begins with players reselecting their unfavorable colors and the distributor providing a new set of bullets.




In another version of the game the player has another type of gun ( a gun that can shoot outside the board to waist a bullet of color )  still the player cant control the gun.
